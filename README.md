# Didomi Test App
![Didomi Test App CI](https://github.com/dima11221122/didomi-test-app/workflows/Didomi%20Test%20App%20CI/badge.svg)

It's my solution for [Didomi code challenge](https://github.com/didomi/challenges/tree/master/frontend). The app is available on Github Pages.

### Key features :key:

- Thoroughly tested. ~80 tests, ~90% code coverage :lock:
- Front-end level mocks of http-request, using my package [ngx-mock-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ngx-mock-server) (yes, it can be effortlessly deployed on Github Pages :palm_tree:)
- Handy [Compodoc](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@compodoc/compodoc) documentation. Do you not want to generate it manually? Check it out online! :green_book:
- Running tests and app deployment on push via Github Actions

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 9.1.4.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Generate documentation

Run `npm run compodoc` to generate documentation via [Compodoc](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@compodoc/compodoc). The documentation will be stored in the `dist/docs` directory.
